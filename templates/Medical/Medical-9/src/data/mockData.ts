      'HbA1c measures the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your red blood cells coated with sugar (glycated). Because red blood cells live for approximately 120 days, this blood test reflects your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months.',
      'Why is HbA1c such an essential metric? While daily blood sugar readings capture instantaneous moments, HbA1c provides a broad panoramic view. An HbA1c below 5.7% is normal; 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes; and 6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.',

      'Receiving a prediabetes diagnosis can be stressful, but medically it is an encouraging window of opportunity. The pancreas is still producing insulin, but muscle and liver cells have become resistant to its signal.',
      'By introducing modest, sustainable adjustments—such as losing 5% to 7% of body weight if carrying excess weight and engaging in 150 minutes of weekly activity—you reduce the progression risk to Type 2 diabetes by over 58%.',
      'At Gluvia, our PREVENT program combines continuous glucose sensor trial periods with behavioral coaching to help patients reverse prediabetes within 6 to 9 months.'

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Prediabetes is 100% reversible with proactive care',
      '150 minutes of weekly activity improves insulin sensitivity',

      'Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) have transformed diabetes care by replacing static snapshots with real-time continuous arrows showing where your glucose is heading.',
      'One common pitfall for new CGM users is "rage bolusing" or over-eating when seeing a rising or falling trend arrow. Remember that interstitial fluid sensors lag blood glucose by 5 to 10 minutes.',
      'Work with your endocrinologist to set customized high and low alarm thresholds that alert you to actionable trends without causing alarm fatigue.'

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Focus on "Time in Range" (70-180 mg/dL) rather than single peaks',
      'Avoid over-correcting rising trends too rapidly',
      'Share sensor reports with your physician prior to visits'

    summary: 'How muscle contraction absorbs glucose independent of insulin and how to timing workouts effectively.',
    content: [
      'When your skeletal muscles contract during physical activity, they activate a specialized glucose transporter called GLUT4 that moves glucose out of the bloodstream and into muscle cells without needing insulin.',
      'This GLUT4 mechanism remains active for up to 24 hours after exercise, significantly enhancing overall insulin sensitivity.',
      'A simple 10-15 minute walk right after meals helps flatten post-prandial glucose spikes naturally.'

    category: 'General',
    question: 'What is diabetes and how does Gluvia Diabetes Institute specialize in it?',
    answer: 'Diabetes is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Gluvia Diabetes Institute is a dedicated tertiary care center uniting endocrinologists, podiatrists, ophthalmologists, renal specialists, and metabolic dietitians under one roof for comprehensive care.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-2',
    category: 'Monitoring',
    question: 'How often should I check my blood sugar levels?',
    answer: 'Testing frequency depends on your specific type of diabetes and treatment plan. Patients on intensive insulin therapy typically benefit from continuous glucose monitors (CGM) or testing 4-6 times daily. Patients managed with lifestyle or oral medications may test fasting and post-meal levels as recommended by their physician.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-3',
    category: 'Diagnostics',
    question: 'What is HbA1c and why is it checked every 3 to 6 months?',
    answer: 'HbA1c measures the percentage of hemoglobin coated with glucose, reflecting your average blood sugar levels over the preceding 2 to 3 months. It provides an objective benchmark of overall glycemic control and helps us tailor your care plan to prevent long-term microvascular complications.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    category: 'Prevention',
    question: 'Can Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes be reversed?',
    answer: 'Prediabetes can frequently be reversed back to normal glucose tolerance through structured lifestyle intervention. For Type 2 diabetes, achieving metabolic remission (normal HbA1c without glucose-lowering medication for 3+ months) is achievable for many individuals, particularly when caught early through our PREVENT and BALANCE programs.'

    category: 'Consultation',
    question: 'What happens during my first consultation at Gluvia?',
    answer: 'Your initial consultation lasts 60 to 90 minutes. It includes a complete metabolic history review, physical examination, microvascular risk screening, on-site point-of-care HbA1c testing if needed, and a collaborative discussion to design your personalized care blueprint.'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    category: 'Nutrition',
    question: 'Do you provide personalized nutrition counseling?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our clinical nutritionists work closely with you to design meals that honor your cultural background, taste preferences, and daily routine. We avoid restrictive diets and focus on sustainable glycemic balance using the Diabetes Plate Method and CGM feedback.'
